# Python-Practice üêç

Welcome to my **Python-Practice** repository! üéâ This repository contains a collection of coding exercises and solutions to strengthen problem-solving skills in Python. It focuses on fundamental and advanced concepts in data structures and algorithms.

## üìÇ Topics Covered

This repository includes solutions and examples for the following topics:

1. **Array**  
   - Basic operations (insertion, deletion, traversal)  
   - Sliding window techniques  
   - Prefix sums and optimization problems  

2. **String**  
   - String manipulation techniques  
   - Palindrome-related problems  
   - Pattern matching algorithms  

3. **Recursion**  
   - Understanding base and recursive cases  
   - Solving problems like factorial, Fibonacci, and permutations  

4. **Linked List**  
   - Singly and doubly linked lists  
   - Operations (reverse, merge, detect cycles)  

5. **Tree**  
   - Binary trees, binary search trees (BSTs) 
   - Tree traversal algorithms
   - Problems like Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) and tree diameter  

6. **Searching**  
   - Linear and binary search algorithms  
   - Search problems in sorted arrays  

7. **Sorting**  
   - Common algorithms: bubble sort, merge sort, quicksort, insertion sort

8. **Backtracking**  
   - Classic problems like N-Queens, Sudoku solver, and permutations  
   - Subset and combination generation
